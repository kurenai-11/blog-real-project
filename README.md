# XBlog MERN Project

# Starting in development mode

1. Make sure to install dependencies.
   You can use **install-deps-npm.sh** for that or go into frontend/ and backend/ do it manually.
   `./install-deps-npm.sh`

2. Install concurrently globally
   `npm install -g concurrently`

3. You can then start both the frontend and backend with
   `./run-dev.sh`

By default frontend will run at port 5173 and backend at port 5000.
